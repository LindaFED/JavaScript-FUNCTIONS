# JavaScript-FUNCTIONS
DEFINTIONS - INVOCATION - call( ) - apply( ) - COUNTER DILEMMA
In the jsfunctions.js file you will find a code example for each of the arguments in the list below

FUNCTION DEFINTIONS
1. Function Declaration: declared function are not executed immediately. 
They are executed when they are invoked.
2. Function Expressions: a function expression can be stored in a variable.
They are always invoked (called) using the variable name.

THE ARGUMENT OBJECT - JavaScript functions have a built-in object called the arguments object.
The argument object contains an array of the arguments used when the function was called (invoked).
1. Use the arguments object to find the highest value in a list of number.
2. Use the arguments object to create a function to sum all input value.

FUNCTION INVOCATION
1. Invoking a Function as a Method
2. Invoking a Function with a Function Constructor. A constructor invocation creates a new object. 
The new object inherits the properties and methods from its constructor.

FUNCTION call()
1. The JavaScript call() Method
2. The call() Method with Arguments

FUNCTION apply()
With the apply() method, you can write a method that can be used on different objects.
The Difference Between call() and apply():
 - The call() method takes arguments separately.
 - The apply() method takes arguments as an array.
1. The JavaScript apply() Method
2. The apply() method accepts arguments in an array
3. Use apply() method to retun the highest number in an array:
